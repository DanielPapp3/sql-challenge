# sql-challenge

This repo contains the results of an analysis on a SQL Employee Database created using PostgreSQL and data supplied by the instructors. The original data sets can be found in the form of several CSV files within the "Data" folder located inside this repository. The objective was to create tables using the schema.sql file and query those tables to collect specific information using the Query.sql file. Both SQL files can be found in the root directory of this repository.
